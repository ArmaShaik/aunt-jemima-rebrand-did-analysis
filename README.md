🥞 Aunt Jemima Rebrand — Digital Marketing Analytics
This project analyzes the real-world impact of the Aunt Jemima brand retirement and rebranding to Pearl Milling Company. Using R (Radiant & sentiment analysis), Excel, and public datasets, the team evaluated how the rebrand influenced consumer sentiment, stock behavior, and product sales.

🧠 Business Context
On June 17, 2020, PepsiCo’s Quaker Oats announced it would retire the Aunt Jemima brand — a long-standing symbol criticized for racial stereotyping — and rebrand it as the Pearl Milling Company. The decision was part of a broader wave of corporate responses to racial justice movements. This project investigates how this rebranding effort influenced sentiment, brand equity, investor perception, and sales performance.

🛠️ Tools Used
Radiant (R) – for modeling Difference-in-Differences (DiD) sales impact

R – for sentiment scoring, word clouds, and tweet frequency visualizations

Excel – for abnormal return analysis and stock comparison

PowerPoint – for visual storytelling

Public Datasets – Twitter, Stock Market, and Sales Data

🔧 My Role
I contributed to multiple phases of the project:

Conducted sentiment and frequency analysis of tweets pre- and post-rebrand

Modeled sales impact using DiD methodology in Radiant

Evaluated stock performance and abnormal returns in Excel

Interpreted and visualized changes in public discourse through histograms and word clouds

Presented findings in a clear, business-focused narrative

Sentiment Shift: Negative sentiment (anger, fear) was high on June 17, but positive and trust-related tones grew afterward.

Stock Reaction: PepsiCo’s stock fell 3.41% during the event window — underperforming NASDAQ by 2.65%. However, abnormal return was slightly positive at +0.14%, indicating limited long-term concern.

Public Discourse: Tweets transitioned from emotionally charged words like “racial,” “stereotype,” and “painful” to neutral/adaptive terms like “company,” “milling,” and “new.”
