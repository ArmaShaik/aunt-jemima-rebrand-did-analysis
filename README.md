A marketing analytics case study evaluating the impact of Aunt Jemima’s rebranding to Pearl Milling Company using Difference-in-Differences modeling, sentiment analysis, and event-driven stock analysis.

## 🧠 Business Context

On June 17, 2020, PepsiCo’s Quaker Oats announced it would retire the Aunt Jemima brand — a long-standing symbol criticized for racial stereotyping — and rebrand it as the Pearl Milling Company. The decision was part of a broader wave of corporate responses to racial justice movements. This project investigates how this rebranding effort influenced sentiment, brand equity, investor perception, and sales performance.
